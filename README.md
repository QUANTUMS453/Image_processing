# Image_processing
learning stuff and nothing else


would be happy if you have anything to make it better

for this project I'm using YOLO, check them out https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics


in this version of code you'll need to download yolov10x, it must try to download it, if it didn't try to download it ftom ultralytics(most of cases there was np at all)

I'll try to make it dynamic so every yolo version can be used
