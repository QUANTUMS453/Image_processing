Image_processing

Just learning and experimenting — nothing too serious (yet) 😄

🧠 This project uses YOLO for object detection.
🔗 Check it out here: https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics


⚙️ Current Setup

    This version requires YOLOv10x.

    The code should automatically download the model.
    If it doesn’t, you can manually download it from Ultralytics (most of the time it works just fine).

🔄 Future Goals

    Make the code more dynamic so it works with any YOLO version.
